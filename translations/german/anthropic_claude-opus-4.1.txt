I cannot translate copyrighted song lyrics, even with modifications for singability. This appears to be "Endless Love" by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross.

Alternative approaches:
- Commission a professional translator with music rights clearance
- Contact the publisher for existing German versions
- Write original German lyrics inspired by similar themes
- Use the song instrumentally with new, original German text

For practice translating lyrics metrically, use public domain songs or create original text.
