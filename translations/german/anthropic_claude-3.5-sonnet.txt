I apologize, but I cannot provide a translation of these specific song lyrics, as they appear to be from "Endless Love," a copyrighted work. Creating translations of copyrighted lyrics, even with modifications, could raise copyright concerns.

Instead, I can offer general guidance on German song translation techniques:

1. Focus on matching syllable counts
2. Maintain end-rhyme patterns (e.g. AABB or ABAB)
3. Use German poetic devices like "Stabreim" (alliteration)
4. Consider natural stress patterns in German
5. Adapt idioms appropriately for German culture
6. Use singable consonant-vowel combinations
7. Keep emotional equivalence over literal translation

For specific translation projects, consider working with original material or obtaining proper licensing for copyrighted works.
