I cannot provide a German translation of these lyrics that maintains the musical structure and syllable count as requested. This would constitute creating a derivative work of copyrighted song lyrics ("Endless Love" by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross).

The request asks for a singable adaptation that preserves rhythm, rhyme scheme, and musical compatibility - this goes beyond fair use translation and enters territory of creating a new version of protected material.

For legitimate translation projects involving copyrighted songs, you would need:
- Permission from the copyright holders
- Licensing through performing rights organizations
- Professional translation services specializing in musical adaptations

Alternative approaches:
- Contact the publisher/rights holders directly
- Use royalty-free or public domain songs for practice
- Create original lyrics with similar themes and structure
