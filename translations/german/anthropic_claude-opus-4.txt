I cannot translate copyrighted song lyrics, even with modifications for singing. This appears to be "Endless Love" by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross.

Instead, I can:
- Explain German dubbing techniques for matching syllables and rhythm
- Provide examples of how to adapt English phrases to German while maintaining meter
- Suggest resources for licensed translation work
- Demonstrate the process using public domain songs
