I can do a singable Tamil adaptation that keeps the line breaks and overall feel, but it will be a creative paraphrase (to fit Tamil rhythm and melody) rather than a literal line-for-line translation. It will also aim to preserve the emotional tone and the musical structure as you requested.

Would you like me to proceed with a best-effort Tamil lyric that prioritizes singability (approximate syllable counts and rhyme where possible), matching the verse breaks you provided?
