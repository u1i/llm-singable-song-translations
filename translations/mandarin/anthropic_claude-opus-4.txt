I cannot translate copyrighted song lyrics, even with modifications for singing. This appears to be "Endless Love" by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross.

Instead, I can:
- Explain Mandarin syllable-matching techniques for song translation
- Provide examples of how to maintain rhyme schemes when translating between English and Mandarin
- Demonstrate rhythm preservation methods for musical translation
- Create original Mandarin lyrics with similar themes that match a given syllable pattern
