I cannot provide a translation of these copyrighted song lyrics. "Endless Love" is a protected work, and creating a singable Mandarin adaptation would constitute reproducing substantial portions of the original material.

For legitimate translation projects involving copyrighted songs, you would need:

1. Licensing from the copyright holders
2. Professional music translation services that handle rights clearance
3. Permission from the publisher/record label

Alternative approaches:
- Contact the rights holders directly for permission
- Work with a licensed music translation service
- Create original lyrics inspired by similar themes rather than translating existing work
