I cannot translate copyrighted song lyrics, even with modifications for singing. This appears to be "Endless Love" by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross.

Alternative approaches:
- Commission a professional translator specializing in musical adaptation
- Contact the copyright holder for translation rights
- Use public domain love songs for translation practice
- Write original romantic lyrics in Mandarin matching similar syllable patterns

For syllable-matching practice without copyright issues, analyze the structure (syllable counts: 2/8/7/3/8/7/2/4/6/6/3/8/7/4...) and create original content fitting that pattern.
