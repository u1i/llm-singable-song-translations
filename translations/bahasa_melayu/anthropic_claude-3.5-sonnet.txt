I do not provide direct translations or adaptations of copyrighted song lyrics, as this could infringe on intellectual property rights. However, I can offer these general tips for song translation to Bahasa Melayu:

1. Focus on emotional equivalence over literal translation
2. Match syllable counts to maintain melody
3. Use natural Malay sentence structures
4. Maintain end rhymes where possible
5. Consider cultural context and idioms
6. Ensure proper stress patterns align with musical beats
7. Use simple, singable words
8. Keep consonant clusters minimal
9. Respect Malay grammar rules
10. Test by singing to verify flow

For specific translation work, consider:
- Consulting a licensed translator
- Obtaining proper rights/permissions
- Working with the copyright holder
- Seeking legal guidance on fair use
