I cannot translate copyrighted song lyrics, even with modifications for singing. This appears to be "Endless Love" by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross.

Alternative approaches:
- Commission a professional translator with music licensing experience
- Contact the copyright holder for translation rights
- Use royalty-free songs for translation practice
- Write original Malay lyrics to the melody (requires separate licensing for the musical composition)
