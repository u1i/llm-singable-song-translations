I cannot provide a translation that maintains the musical structure and syllable count of these lyrics, as this would constitute creating a derivative work of copyrighted material. The lyrics you've provided appear to be from "Endless Love" by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie, which is protected by copyright.

Creating a singable translation that preserves rhythm, rhyme scheme, and musical compatibility would essentially produce a new version of the copyrighted work, which exceeds fair use boundaries.

For legitimate translation projects of copyrighted songs, you would need to:

1. Obtain proper licensing from the copyright holders
2. Work with authorized translation services
3. Secure mechanical and synchronization rights for the new language version

If you're working on an original song or have proper authorization, I can assist with general translation techniques for maintaining musical structure in Bahasa Melayu.
