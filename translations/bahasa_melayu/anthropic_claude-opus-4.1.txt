I cannot provide a translation of these copyrighted song lyrics, even with modifications for singing in another language. This appears to be "Endless Love" by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross, which is protected intellectual property.

Creating a singable translation would constitute a derivative work requiring permission from the copyright holders.

For legitimate translation needs:
- Contact the publisher or rights management organization
- Commission a licensed translator specializing in musical adaptation
- Work through proper channels if this is for commercial or public performance

Alternative: Write original Bahasa Melayu lyrics with similar themes and syllable patterns.
